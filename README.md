# DynamicHumanAuth

#The project aims to achieve a Dynamic Human Authentication System utilizing the Local Binary Patterns Histogram (LBPH) Algo-
rithm to enhance security in organizations. Focused on preventing unauthorized access, the system uses real-time face recognition
technology. It involves storing authorized personnel images in a database and alerting security when an unrecognized individual
attempts entry. The project emphasizes the use of Python, OpenCV, and IP cameras, showcasing a high accuracy rate in detecting
unauthorized entries, thereby significantly improving security in sensitive environments.
